          <h2>What are your hobbies?</h2>
          <p>
            My hobbies are very few compared to most people my age, but i´ll say
            that´s what made me special. I built an interest in fashion when I
            was 10 years of age, and I have explored some parts of the fashion
            world. Also, I recently gained some interest baking and I baked an
            Apple cupcake a few weeks ago.

          <p>
            In 2 years, I will be in the 9th Grade and I currently don´t have
            any big plans at the moment as i am still exploring different fields
            and hopefully, I find what suits me best.
